"""
Clarity Agent — Query comprehension and disambiguation node.

Uses the **fast** model tier (``grok-3-mini-latest``) to perform a
binary classification on the user's query:

    - **"clear"**: The query is specific enough to proceed with research.
    - **"needs_clarification"**: The query is vague, ambiguous, or
      missing critical context.

When clarification is needed, the agent triggers a LangGraph
``interrupt()`` to pause the graph and yield control to the user
via the CLI.  Upon resumption, the user's clarification is merged
into the conversation history and the clarity check re-runs.

Cost Rationale:
    This is a classification task — no deep reasoning required.
    Using ``grok-3-mini-latest`` keeps latency and cost minimal.

_CLARITY_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """\
You are a Clarity Assessment Specialist in a multi-agent business research system.

Your SOLE job is to evaluate whether the user's query is clear and specific enough \
to conduct meaningful business research.

## Evaluation Criteria

A query is **CLEAR** if it:
- Identifies a specific company, industry, market, or business topic
- Has a discernible research objective (e.g., competitive analysis, market sizing, \
financial performance, trend analysis)
- Provides enough context to formulate targeted search queries

A query **NEEDS CLARIFICATION** if it:
- Is extremely vague (e.g., "tell me about business")
- References unnamed entities (e.g., "that company", "the stock")
- Could refer to multiple unrelated topics without disambiguation
- Lacks any actionable research direction

## Important Guidelines

- Be GENEROUS in your assessment. If the query has a clear subject and implied \
research goal, mark it as "clear" even if it could be more specific.
- Only flag "needs_clarification" when the query is genuinely too vague to research.
- When asking for clarification, be specific about WHAT information you need.
- Consider the full conversation history for context — a short follow-up like \
"what about their competitors?" is CLEAR if the prior context identifies the subject.

    """Evaluate whether the user's query is clear enough for research.

    This is a LangGraph node function that:

    1. Builds a prompt from the conversation history + current query.
    2. Calls the **fast** Grok model with structured output to get a
       binary classification.
    3. If ``"clear"`` → returns updated state fields to proceed.
    4. If ``"needs_clarification"`` → calls ``interrupt()`` to pause
       the graph.  When the user provides input and the graph resumes,
       the clarification is injected and the node re-evaluates.

    Args:
        state: The current graph state containing ``messages``,
            ``user_query``, and conversation history.

    Returns:
        A dict of state updates (when clear) or a ``Command`` (after
        interrupt resumption).
